**The codes for computing *the scale-dependent peak height function* (scale-PKHF) and *the scale-dependent valley depth function* (scale-VLYDF) of the cosmic-log density field, and forecasting their constraining power on cosmological parameters.**

If you use our codes or your research is related to our paper, please kindly cite the following paper.
